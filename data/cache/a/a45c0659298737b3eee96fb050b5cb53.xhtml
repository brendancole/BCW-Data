<p>
Which file types you can upload via the media manager popup or the fullscreen media manager is configured through the <code>conf/mime.conf</code> file. Additional mimetypes should be added in <code>mime.local.conf</code>. The file expects an extension (without the dot) and a mime type. Prefixing the mime type with an exclamation mark (!) will force the browser to present a download dialog, even if a browser plugin for the file in question exists.

<pre class="code"># this would play in the browser (if supported):
wav         audio/wav

# this would be downloaded
wav         !audio/wav</pre>

<p>
File type icons can be added by placing an image file (PNG or GIF) named after the file extension into <code>lib/images/fileicons/</code>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> because the stylesheet used for assigning the fileicons gets cached you need to force a rebuild by touching one of the config files.
